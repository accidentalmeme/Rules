PET Discord Rules

Welcome to the PET discord! Here we have a few simple rules to follow. They're very easy to follow and as such violations will be punished strictly.

**1. Be respectful of others.** Pinewood strives to be a welcoming and friendly community. For that reason harassment, discrimination, bullying, doxxing and drama are not allowed (even if you are joking). We also don't allow you to ship other people without their consent. Harassment/Bullying in DMs can be moderated if reported.

**2. No NSFW content.** As a group with members of all ages, we do not allow: Porn, Gore, Sexual Fanfics, Bestiality, and almost all real-life bodily floods. Images or Videos suggestive of NSFW are also prohibited. Keep text PG/PG-13. NSFW involving children will result in a permanent ban.

**3. No spam.** In order to keep our server on topic, we do not allow spam or off-topic posts. This means no advertising (even in DMs), mass pings, ghost pings, excessive use of all caps, excessive repetition, large images, over posting, trolling, and etc are not allowed. In order to protect peoples health, flashing lights, extremely loud audio, and other health risks are not allowed. 

**4. Keep stuff in the correct channel.** You can find out what each channel is for by reading the channel topic. This also includes instructions on how to use channels such as #handbook-violator-reports. You should also make sure to read the pinned messages of channels as they contain important information most of the time. For example, do not use bot commands outside of #bot-commands (Though moderators are allowed to do this).

**5. You must be at least 13 years old to be here.** In order to comply with Discord ToS, we are required to remove anyone under 13 years old, or claiming to be so. We **may** allow you to provide proof that you are over 13 before removing you. However, this does not mean you should joke about your age. Even if you are older than 13, it is still preferred that you keep discussion of your age to a minimum.

**6. Moderators may apply discretion when necessary.**  In some cases, behavior does not violate the rules, but is still unwelcome. Moderators may apply sanctions at their discretion, in order to keep the server safe and welcoming! With some common sense, sanctions under this rule should be rare.

If you see someone else violating these rules, or you need assistance, please send a message to an *online* moderator. (Division Trainer/Team Chief/PIA). We ask that you do not spam moderators: one message is usually enough.
